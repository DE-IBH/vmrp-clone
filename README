VMware Resource Pool Clone
==========================

vmrp-clone consists of two small scripts. vmrp-clone-backup gets the
current resource pool configuration of a cluster and saves it into a
XML file. vmrp-clone-restore can be used to create/change a resource
pool configuration using this XML file.
